Pardon Vinh, tu as raison. Je vais être extrêmement rigoureux : pour chaque page, tu auras le **Pitch**, la **Question**, et surtout la **Réponse** associée, le tout en anglais très simple (niveau collège/lycée pour assurer la prononciation).

Voici le document corrigé et complet pour ton copier-coller Word.

**PAGE 37: VISION (UNLOCK POTENTIAL)**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"Twin is not just a tool. It is an ecosystem.
Tools work alone. Twin connects them all to create real intelligence."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Do we really need another tool?"
**My Answer:** "Yes, because our current tools are silos. Twin connects them to give us the full picture."

**Question (The Expert):** "Is this just marketing on top of legacy systems?"
**My Answer:** "No. It transforms raw data into a clear map. It brings logic to our old data."

---

**PAGE 38: FROM DATA TO ACTION**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"Today, we possess too much data. We are reactive.
Tomorrow, with Twin, we want to anticipate. We turn data into answers."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Is this a Data Lake?"
**My Answer:** "No. A Data Lake stores files. Twin understands the links between servers and apps."

**Question (The Expert):** "How do you handle bad data quality?"
**My Answer:** "We filter it. If the source is bad, Twin flags it. It does not blindly copy."

**PAGE 40: THE TWO BRAINS (NEURO-SYMBOLIC)**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"We use two systems. Like a human brain.
System 1 is the AI. It is fast and speaks well.
System 2 is the Graph. It is logical and holds the truth."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Why do we need two systems?"
**My Answer:** "Because AI can make mistakes. The Graph checks the facts. We need both."

**Question (The Expert):** "Why not just use a Vector Database (RAG)?"
**My Answer:** "RAG finds text. The Graph finds connections. We need connections to understand the impact."

---

**PAGE 41: THE CHECK LOOP**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"Safety first. We use a loop.
First, understand the question.
Second, check the facts in the Graph.
Third, answer."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Is it slow?"
**My Answer:** "It takes one second more. But it is safe."

**Question (The Expert):** "Does this kill real-time performance?"
**My Answer:** "In banking, being right is more important than being fast."

---

**PAGE 42: THE MAP (ARCHITECTURE)**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"This is our engine.
We take data from everywhere. We clean it. We put it in TigerGraph.
Now, we have a live map of IT."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Do you copy all our logs?"
**My Answer:** "No. We only track important changes. We keep the system light."

**Question (The Expert):** "Is TigerGraph scalable?"
**My Answer:** "Yes. It is designed for massive data. It can handle our volume easily."

---

**PAGE 43: DOCS TO KNOWLEDGE (GRAPHRAG)**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"We don't just search PDFs.
We link the document directly to the server in the Graph.
The Agent knows exactly how to fix this specific machine."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Is it like Google Search?"
**My Answer:** "Google gives you a list of links. Twin gives you the exact answer."

**Question (The Expert):** "What if the documentation is outdated?"
**My Answer:** "The Agent checks the date. If it is old, it warns the user."

---

**PAGE 44: NOT JUST A LIST**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"This is not a list of servers.
It is a dynamic view.
We see who depends on who."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Is this a CMDB?"
**My Answer:** "A CMDB is a static list. Twin is live. It shows what is happening now."

**Question (The Expert):** "Do you replace Dynatrace?"
**My Answer:** "No. We use their alerts. But we add the business context."

---

**PAGE 45: WHY A GRAPH DATABASE?**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"IT is a network. Relational databases are bad at networks.
If a disk fails here, what breaks over there? Only a Graph can see this."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Why not use SQL?"
**My Answer:** "SQL is too slow for complex links. Graph is instant."

**Question (The Expert):** "Can't you do joins in a standard database?"
**My Answer:** "Too many joins kill the database. For impact analysis, Graph is the only way."

---

**PAGE 47: WHAT IS AN AGENT?**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"An Agent is not a Chatbot.
A chatbot talks. An agent acts.
It decides the best way to solve a problem."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Is it just a script?"
**My Answer:** "A script is rigid. An agent adapts to the situation."

**Question (The Expert):** "What if the Agent loops indefinitely?"
**My Answer:** "Our Orchestrator stops it immediately. We have strict controls."

---

**PAGE 48: THE TEAM (ORCHESTRATION)**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"One agent is not enough. We built a team.
One expert for the map. One expert for the docs. One expert for the logs."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Why so many agents?"
**My Answer:** "Specialists are better than generalists. It is easier to manage."

**Question (The Expert):** "Does this complexity add latency?"
**My Answer:** "A little bit. But it prevents creating a 'God-Mode' AI that is impossible to fix."

---

**PAGE 49: MATURITY LEVELS**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"We go step by step.
Level 1 is search. Level 4 is action.
But for Level 4, a human must always validate."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Can it fix problems alone?"
**My Answer:** "Not yet. We always keep a human in the loop."

**Question (The Expert):** "Are you deploying Self-Healing in production?"
**My Answer:** "No. We start with assistance. Self-healing is for the future."

---

**PAGE 51: THE FUTURE (PREDICTION)**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"The next step is prediction.
We want to know the problem before it happens."

**Question (The Beginner):** "Is it magic?"
**My Answer:** "No, it is mathematics. We use graph algorithms."

**Question (The Expert):** "Is this technology ready?"
**My Answer:** "The algorithms are ready in TigerGraph. We are testing them now."

---

**PAGE 52: WORLD MODELS**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"We want to simulate actions. Like a flight simulator for IT.
'If I cut this cable, what happens?' The Twin will tell us."

**Question (The Beginner):** "How does it work?"
**My Answer:** "It uses all our past data to learn how the system reacts."

**Question (The Expert):** "Do you have enough training data?"
**My Answer:** "Yes. We are collecting it right now with our Data Capture layer."

---

**PAGE 55: SELECT THE TEAM**

**My Pitch (Simple)**
"Now, we choose the team.
We look at the cost. We look at the value.
We choose the right strategy."

**Question (The Beginner):** "How do we choose?"
**My Answer:** "We focus on the biggest pain points for the bank."
