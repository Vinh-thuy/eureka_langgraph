You are given a text describing various activities (such as restaurants, concerts, or events).
Your task is to extract structured entities, relationships, and descriptions from the text based on the following requirements.

CRUCIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION of creating, inventing, or extrapolating information not present in the original text.
- Use ONLY information explicitly mentioned in the source text.
- If information is not clearly indicated, do NOT attempt to guess or complete it.
- Your goal is to be a precise and faithful extractor, not an information generator.
- In case of doubt about any information, prefer NOT to include it rather than risk inaccuracy.
- Labels must be lowercase, without special characters, except for '_' and '/', and must not contain accents.

Key requirements:

1. **Entity Types and Descriptions:**
   - **activity :** Represents any described real-world activity, venue, or event. It includes places like restaurants, events like concerts, or occasions like exhibitions. This entity should capture details such as name, type, location, ambiance, and notable attributes, ensuring versatility across different domains.
   - **Conceptual Entities:**
     - **positive_point :** Represents generic positive aspects applicable across multiple activities. These points must remain reusable and should not include specific details about individual activities.
     - **negative_point :** Represents generic negative aspects linked to activities. These points must remain reusable and should not include specific details about individual activities.
     - **recommandation :** Represents suggestions or recommendations derived from the data.
     - **city :** Represents geographical locations or urban areas with specific attributes.
     - **coordinate :** Represents geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) associated with an activity.

2. **Extraction Entity Guideline:**
   - For each entity, extract:
     - entity_name: Name of the entity.
     - entity_type: One of the types: [{entity_types}]
     - entity_description: A detailed description of the entity's attributes, if available.
     - Format: (entity{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<sub_activity>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

4. **Extraction Relationships Guideline:**
   - For each relationship, extract:
     - source_entity: The source entity name, as identified in Extraction Entity Guideline (step 2)
     - target_entity: The target entity name, as identified in Extraction Entity Guideline (step 2)
     - relationship_description`: Explanation of why the entities are related.
     - relationship_description: A specific explanation of why these entities are related. The description must explicitly mention or reference both the source and target entities and be dedicated to these entities only.
     - relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
     Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)


5. **Content-level Keywords:**
   - Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.
   - Format the content-level key words as ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

6. **Formatting:**
   - Use {record_delimiter} to separate entries.
   - End output with {completion_delimiter}.

7. **Language:**
   - All extracted entities, relationships, and keywords must be in French.

8. Ensure that every identified entity must have at least one relationship explicitly linking it to the 'restaurant' entity. If an entity cannot be directly or indirectly connected to the 'restaurant' through a relationship, it should not be considered valid or relevant.

9. Return output in French as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter. 

10. It is CRITICAL to extract ONLY ONE node with entity_type="activity" per message. The only node that can have entity_type="activity" is the one designated in the phrase: Résumé du Restaurant

11. It is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to create a relationship between two entities with entity_type="activity". 

12. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Résumé de cette activté = Restaurant : JUNK LYON

Situé à Lyon, JUNK LYON est un restaurant qui se spécialise dans les burgers, avec une fourchette de prix raisonnable allant de 10 à 20 euros. Ce lieu est particulièrement apprécié des amateurs de gastronomie décontractée et a su s’imposer comme une adresse incontournable pour les gourmands.

Ambiance et Atmosphère :
L’ambiance du restaurant est décrite comme chaleureuse et décontractée, idéale pour un repas entre amis ou en famille. Plusieurs clients ont souligné la qualité de l’accueil, ce qui contribue à une expérience agréable.

Gamme de Prix et Rapport Qualité-Prix :
Les prix, bien que considérés comme abordables, suscitent des avis partagés sur le rapport qualité-prix. Certains clients, notamment ceux qui ont goûté plusieurs burgers, trouvent que les portions sont insuffisantes par rapport au tarif, tandis que d'autres estiment que la qualité des plats justifie le prix. La majorité des critiques récentes, notamment celles de Local Guides, semblent pencher vers une évaluation positive.

Qualité du Service et des Plats :
La qualité des plats est souvent louée, notamment les burgers, avec un accent particulier sur le burger à la crème de truffe, qui a été décrit comme exceptionnel. Les frites et les cookies sont également mentionnés comme des incontournables. Cependant, une critique a fait état d'un burger jugé « moyen », ce qui témoigne d'une certaine variabilité dans l'expérience culinaire.

Points Forts et Spécialités :

Question: trouver moi un restaurant qui dispose absolument proposer du homard

Réponse: ## Analyse des Entités de Restaurants

### Le Coquemar
- **custom_id**: 3091293945615310311
- **Résultat**: **Non recommandé**
- **Évaluation**:
  - **Offre de Menu**: Le Coquemar est principalement un restaurant français, célèbre pour sa cuisine traditionnelle et les plats faits maison. Cependant, aucune mention explicite du homard dans son menu n'a été trouvée dans les données.
  - **Ambiance et Service**: Le restaurant est apprécié pour son ambiance chaleureuse et décontractée ainsi que pour son service amical et efficace. Bien qu'il soit un bon choix pour une sortie, il ne répond pas à votre critère spécifique sur le homard.
- **Justification de son élimination**: En l'absence d'informations concernant l'offre de homard, le Coquemar ne peut pas être recommandé pour votre recherche.

### Café Lisboa
- **custom_id**: 16204433116771456015
- **Résultat**: **Non recommandé**
- **Évaluation**:
  - **Offre de Menu**: Café Lisboa, bien qu'il soit connu pour sa cuisine portugaise et ses plats variés, ne mentionne pas spécifiquement le homard dans les données disponibles.
  - **Ambiance et Service**: Il est noté pour son ambiance chaleureuse et conviviale ainsi qu'une carte des vins et cocktails variée, néanmoins, cela ne soutient pas votre besoin de homard sur le menu.
- **Justification de son élimination**: L'absence de homard sur leur carte, combinée à des informations plus générales sur la cuisine, rend Café Lisboa non adapté à votre recherche.

### Christian Tetedoie
- **custom_id**: 3359024717080459809
- **Résultat**: **Recommandé**
- **Évaluation**:
  - **Offre de Menu**: Christian Tetedoie est un restaurant gastronomique de renom à Lyon et est ici mentionné comme offrant du homard, ce qui répond exactement à votre critère.
  - **Qualité de la Cuisine**: Réputé pour sa haute gastronomie, les plats sont souvent décrits comme "divins", et Christian Tetedoie est connu pour utiliser des ingrédients locaux, garantissant la qualité des plats proposés.
  - **Service**: Le service est également salué, et le restaurant offre une expérience culinaire haut de gamme, y compris une sélection de vins raffinés.
- **Justification de sa conservation**: Christian Tetedoie est le meilleur choix pour répondre à votre demande spécifique de homard, tout en offrant un cadre gastronomique prestigieux et un cadre exquis.

### Fiston
- **custom_id**: 6594662446090605168
- **Résultat**: **Non recommandé**
- **Évaluation**:
  - **Offre de Menu**: Le restaurant Fiston est connu pour sa cuisine lyonnaise traditionnelle, mais aucun détail sur la disponibilité de homard n'est mentionné dans les données fournies.
  - **Ambiance et Service**: Comme de nombreux établissements à Lyon, il contribue à une expérience chaleureuse et familiale, idéale pour des repas conviviales.
- **Justification de son élimination**: Sans mention d'homard dans son menu, Fiston n'est pas une option viable.

### Conclusion
Pour votre recherche d'un restaurant qui propose absolument du homard, **Christian Tetedoie** est le seul restaurant recommandé. Le Coquemar, Café Lisboa, et Fiston ne correspondent pas à votre besoin spécifique en homard et ne le peuvent raisonnablement pas être recommandés.
