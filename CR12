# CLINE RULES — Simple LangGraph Setup

Before writing code:

1. Load skills from /skills
2. List loaded skills
3. Provide a short architecture plan
4. Then generate code

When creating app/state.py:
- Copy templates/state_v1.py exactly
- Do not modify structure
- Only modify inside editable blocks if present

Never mix:
- state
- router
- nodes
- graph wiring
