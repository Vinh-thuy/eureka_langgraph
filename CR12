Tu as raison, ces questions sont critiques pour le **Capacity Planning**. Un projet d'IA, même avec une architecture géniale, échoue souvent faute de disponibilité des SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) pour valider les résultats ou faute de budget pour l'infrastructure (surtout en mode "Franchise").

J'ai intégré ces éléments dans une nouvelle section **"Execution & Planning"**.

Voici la version **finale et complète** (en Anglais), structurée pour Microsoft Forms. Tu n'as plus qu'à copier-coller.

## 🔵 SECTION 3: The "TO-BE" (Target Agents)

*Goal: Map the intent to the correct LangGraph Agent.*

### 6. What is the primary "Intent" of the AI Agent?

*Type: Choice (Single Selection)*
*Subtitle: Choose the archetype that best describes the desired behavior.*

* **The Librarian (Search & FAQ):** "I want to ask a question and find the answer in a procedure/doc."
* **The Mapper (Topology & Impact):** "I want to visualize dependencies and understand impact (Graph)."
* **The Investigator (Diagnosis):** "I want to understand the root cause of an incident based on events."
* **The Guardian (Compliance):** "I want to check if a configuration or access right is compliant."
* **The Runner (Automation):** "I want to generate or execute a remediation script/action."
* **The Reporter (Synthesis):** "I want a summary or status report for management."

## 🔴 SECTION 4: Target Data & Franchise Mode (Crucial)

*Goal: Distinguish between Standard Twin (Synthesized Data) and Franchise Mode (Raw/Sensitive Data).*

### 7. What NEW data must the Agent access to succeed?

*Type: Choice (Multiple Selection)*

* **[Standard] Knowledge Base:** Procedures, Docs, Wikis (Vector Store).
* **[Standard] IT Topology:** CMDB, Relations, Assets (TigerGraph).
* **[Standard] Golden Events:** Synthesized Health/Change/Anomaly states (No raw noise).
* **[Standard] Live Metrics:** CPU, RAM, Latency, TPS (Time-Series).
* **[Standard] Identity:** AD Groups, Permissions, Certificates.
* **[FRANCHISE] High Volume Raw Data:** Full historical logs, debug traces (Requires Dedicated Storage).
* **[FRANCHISE] Banking Secrets / PII:** Client Data, Account Numbers, Payment Details (Requires High Security).

### 8. Does this Use Case require specific data retention or legal hold?

*Type: Choice (Single Selection)*

* **No:** Standard retention is fine.
* **Yes:** We need to keep data for Audit/Legal reasons (Long term).

## 🟣 SECTION 5: Value & Maturity (ROI)

*Goal: Assess business value.*

### 9. What is the estimated business value (ROI)?

*Type: Choice (Single Selection)*

* **Efficiency:** Saves hours of manual work (Productivity).
* **MTTR Reduction:** Faster incident resolution (Operational Excellence).
* **Quality/Risk:** Reduces human error or compliance risk.
* **Innovation:** Enables a capability that was previously impossible.

### 10. What is the current maturity of this idea?

*Type: Choice (Single Selection)*

* **Ideation:** Just an idea, no technical specs yet.
* **Documented:** We have the logic/procedure written down.
* **POC / Prototype:** We have a script or code that works locally.
* **In Production:** The logic exists in legacy, we want to migrate to AI.

## 🟠 SECTION 6: Execution & Planning (Resources)

*Goal: Assess feasibility, budget, and timeline (Questions 12 & 13).*

### 11. What is your desired Go-Live Date?

*Type: Date*
*Subtitle: When do you need this Agent to be production-ready?*

*Type: Text (Long Answer)*
*Subtitle: Why is this date critical? (e.g., Regulatory deadline, Major Release, Budget Cycle end).*

### 13. Available Resources & Budget (FTE/Budget)

*Type: Text (Long Answer)*
*Subtitle: What resources can YOU contribute? (e.g., "1 FTE Developer for 2 months", "SME available 2 days/week for validation", "Specific budget allocated for storage").*
*Note: The Digital Twin team provides the platform, but business logic requires Subject Matter Expert availability.*

## 💡 Logic Guide for the Program Team (Do not include in Forms)

*Use this key to triage responses into Jira:*

1. **If Q7 contains "[FRANCHISE]":**
* **Action:** Flag as **High Complexity** & **Cost Impact**. Requires Architecture Review.
* **Risk:** Storage cost & Compliance (PII).


2. **If Q13 is "None" or "Unknown":**
* **Action:** **RISK**. If the requester cannot provide an SME to validate the AI's output, the project will fail (Hallucination risk).


3. **If Q11 (Go-Live) is < 1 month AND Q10 (Maturity) is "Ideation":**
* **Action:** **REJECT** or reset expectations. Unrealistic timeline.


4. **If Q6 is "The Mapper" AND Q5 includes "Excel/Shadow IT":**
* **Action:** Assign to **Graflo STM Team**. Needs data modeling in TigerGraph.


5. **If Q6 is "The Librarian" AND Q4 is "Manual & Documented":**
* **Action:** Assign to **RAG Team**. Low complexity (Ingestion of PDF/Wiki).
